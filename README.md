# ftc_5452_2013-2014

This repository contains the programs used by FTC Team 5452: Robot to the Knee during the 2014 FIRST Championship at St. Louis.

Previous programs and revisions will be added to the repository later, maybe. We didn't use version control back then, so it's hard to sort everything out.
